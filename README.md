# Cube-Game

This 3D "engine" is made out of Java, and uses none of the recomended or sugested implementation of a traditional 3D engine. I made this just from the topp of my head while taking a class in Java. I later exported it to Objective-C and then utilizing the correct technic, using matrix, translations, rotation and other mathematical correct ways of rendering objects in a 3D environment.

So you can cal this project deprecated.
